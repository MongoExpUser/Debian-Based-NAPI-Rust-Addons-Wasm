<!--  
  To use this html file to  successfully test the WASM codes with no error:
  1) Ensure that the index.html file is loaded from a running http or https server.
     A locally deployed server (http://localhost:80/index.html) can also be used.
  2) Ensure that the WASM file (sample.wasm) is located in the root directory of the server.
     The file can also be located in a path relative to the root. If this is so, ensure that the path is changed on line 27.
